### PISA 2018 Education Insights - Data Pipeline


## Project overview

Global Education Insights, a mock company that we work for, had recently acquired the PISA 2018 dataset, a comprehensive survey of
student performance in various countries.

This dataset contained a wealth of information that could help GEI understand the
factors that contribute to student success and identify areas where education
systems can be improved.

However, the dataset was large and complex, making it difficult for GEI's team to
extract meaningful insights from it.

**That's where we came in.**

Our task was to leverage our data engineering skills to analyze the PISA 2018
dataset and develop a functioning dashboard that GEI could use to easily visualise
and interpret the data.

This dashboard would be a critical tool for GEI, helping them to make data-driven
decisions and recommendations.

The project was carried out in a distributed environment in the Cloud, which
will allow for efficient data processing and collaboration among team members.
